This repository contains a simple Python program demonstrating a common error in recursive functions: the lack of a proper base case for negative input values. The factorial function, when given a negative input, will recursively call itself indefinitely, resulting in a RecursionError. The solution demonstrates how to correctly handle negative input values by adding a check at the beginning of the function to return an appropriate value or raise an exception.
